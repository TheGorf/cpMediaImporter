ClassicPress Media Importer

I got tired of using WordPress and getting hacked constantly. I was intrigued by the project <a href="https://classicpress.net">ClassicPress</a> which is a fork of WordPress 4.9. After my last hack, I wanted to start clean and just import a few posts. Especially since there were literally 1000's of compromised junk posts. But I had this this upload directory full of image files. 

This plugin parses a source directory of your choosing, and then moves the files into the new Classipress upload diretory via API. By default this preserves the original upload path. And, I included the option to clear out the Media library prior to copying over. I found it useful if I wanted to tweak the files and try again.

This file is super "simple" so play with it at your own risk. :)
